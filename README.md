### Hi there I'm Danilo ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on some cool bots && my neovim open-source plugin project [nvim-live-share](https://github.com/Raisess/nvim-live-share).
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning TypeScript and later maybe Rust, Go or Lua.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I love vim because others editors sucks.
